# SPL_TOKEN_whitelist

## explain

Develop a Solana smart contract using Rust or Anchor framework to implement a token distribution system. 
This system allows the contract owner to fund the contract with a specific SPL token and set up an airdrop mechanism for whitelisted addresses. 
Each whitelisted address is entitled to claim a pre-defined quantity of the SPL token.
